Application of Socket Programming in Implementing FTP commands such as RETR, STOR, DEL, LS, QUIT to create a server capable of handing multiple clients and judging C/C++ codes against hidden test cases.

# Points to ponder 
1) This is a linux based C++ Code Judge Application capable of sending and recieving multiple files of ANY format.
2) As a Code Judge it will recieve C/C++ files in server from clients and evaluate them on hidden test cases after checking for Compilation or Runtime errors. 
3) FTP commands implemented here are :
   a) RETR : Retrieve file from server.
   b) STOR : Store file to server.
   c) LIST : List all files in server.
   d) QUIT : Exit the program
   e) DELE : Delete a file from server.
